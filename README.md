## Updates

Last Update:  10/02/19

What was Updated: I fixed my issue with the game not reaching the score screen.  I reordered my conditional statement to only show the end score screen if the last question was answered, OTHERWISE, continue to the next question.  It is in the if/else statement of the nextQuestion function.

## Problems

The biggest struggle I had with this assignment was properly chaining all my functions and conditional statements.  On the surface, the aspects of a trivia game did not seem so complex.  However, making sure the proper questions and answers were displaying, transition from correct or incorrect answers, and actually reaching the end of the game we all bigger challenges for me than I considered from the start.
