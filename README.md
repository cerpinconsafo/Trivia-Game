## Updates

Last Update:  10/02/19

What was Updated: I fixed my issue with the game not reaching the score screen.  I reordered my conditional statement to only show the end score screen if the last question was answered, OTHERWISE, continue to the next question.  It is in the if/else statement of the nextQuestion function.

## Assignment Details

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.


**[Click Here to Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/xhmmiRmxQ8Q)**.

* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).

## Problems

The biggest struggle I had with this assignment was properly chaining all my functions and conditional statements.  On the surface, the aspects of a trivia game did not seem so complex.  However, making sure the proper questions and answers were displaying, transition from correct or incorrect answers, and actually reaching the end of the game we all bigger challenges for me than I considered from the start.
